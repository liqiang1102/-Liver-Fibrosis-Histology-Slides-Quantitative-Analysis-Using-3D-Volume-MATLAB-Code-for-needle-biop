-------------------------------------------------------------------



## Main features
* The code in code_hpc can be used in the HPC cluster to process gigabytes WSI images.
* The code in code_local is a example, which can be used in the local computer to test small image dataset.


*  First step: image preprocessing for color deconvolution
    1) imagepreprocessing.m: read image data and color deconvolution;
     Input: image file path
    % read the image file; 
* Second step: calculating the fibrosis ratio and needle biopsycross-section visualization.
   1) test.m: input the tube and tissue size parameters, point coordinate position.  
       Input: image file path, and tube parameters and penetration point.

* modeltest.m: The testing model is constructed by pure color blocks for tesing tube tubevoxel.m


## Matlab Code: 

1. imagepreprocessing.m: read image data and color deconvolution; 
   3) Create several folder path under one project folder : 
   origin: store the sliced image from ndpi;
   H :for red pixel color deconvolution;
   E : for blue pixel color deconvolution;
   Imgsrc1 : combine the H and E image to create labeled image;
   Imgsrc2: image to rgb;
2. test.m: input the tube and tissue size parameters, point coordinate position. 

3. normalizeStaining.m : color deconvolution function.

4. tubevoxel.m: calculate the discrete point 3d space coordinate position.

5. tissuemodel.m: 1) build the tissue by using the tissue image slides from origin file;
       2) calculate the blue voxels ratio which represent the cancer area percentage;
       3) the tube cross-section image visualization;
6. modeltest.m: The testing model is constructed by pure color blocks for tesing tube tubevoxel.m

7. labelimg.m : is function combine the H and E into labeled image;
